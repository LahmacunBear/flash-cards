# flash-cards

## General

Simple page for flashcards, likely vocabulary learning, and nice dark theme UI. You specify how confident you are with each card, based on which it reccomends new cards (this is all done through JS). You can adjust the wait periods while using it.

## Words

Under hidden-div, you can adjust the words used, the word first, definition second, seperated by # and each line must also end with #, a new line marking a new word.

## Mechanism

The mechanism is such that the more familiar the user is with the word, the later they see it. This wait time (by default, these are a fifth, two fifths, three fifths and four fifths of the original word-list's length) can be adjusted on the page by using the buttons to the right.
